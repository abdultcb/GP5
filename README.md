Apple’s iBeacon technology is popping up everywhere, but mostly in the retail as you’re well aware of. We believe iBeacon will find a firm foothold in the future of location-based startups including those that aren’t necessarily connected to retail. 

Most modern mobile phones are equipped with Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy — a technology that allows to scan a physical environment for so called beacons. A beacon is a Bluetooth device, that periodically broadcasts a specific ID. By measuring the strength of the incoming signal, a receiver would not only be able to identify specific devices by their ID, but can also estimate the distance to them from the strength of the radio signal.

There are different specifications of the beacon advertising data — a popular one is the iBeacon specification. Receiver and Transmitter obviously have to be able to use the same specs. Apple has integrated transmitter capabilities in its Core Location Framework so it is fairly easy to build an iBeacon sending mobile app.
